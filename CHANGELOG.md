- Added `supabase/v32-poll-attendee-patch.sql` for existing projects.

- Kept poll overlays interactive while the live audience view is locked.
- Added a persistent Live Questions panel back into the admin controls.
- Questions submitted from the user side now show in the admin questions panel.


## v27 Confidence Poll Fit
- Fitted live poll results inside the confidence monitor current-slide panel.
- Reduced poll question/results typography so results no longer overflow the confidence box.
- Preserved projector, scripture, OBS, user slave mode, and mobile controller behavior.

## Notes

This cleanup intentionally does not add login, database editing, markdown loading, or a drag-and-drop lesson builder. Those should come later after the static live presentation system stays stable.

## v31 Admin tabs + attendee check-in fix

## v38 Default Route Lesson Selector
- Kept Lesson 1 and Lesson 2 in the same app.
- Admin lesson buttons now control the selected lesson for all permanent output routes.
- `/projector`, `/scriptures`, `/confidence`, `/mobile`, `/obslowerthirds`, and `/obsslides` can stay unchanged during live setup.
